# Project 1
## The objective of this project is to show how the Summer Olympic Games have evolved over the years and their relation to the political and social issues such as gender equality or racial justice.
## Some notes:
- "athlete_events.csv" and "noc_regions.csv" are from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).
- "Continents.csv" is an upgrade of "Countries-Continents.csv" which contains information about coutries and their contients I found on Github (https://github.com/dbouquin/IS_608/blob/master/NanosatDB_munging/Countries-Continents.csv).
- All the codes for preprocessing and visualizations are in "Project 1.ipynb".
